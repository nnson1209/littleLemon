---

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following software is installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js)

If Node.js is not installed, download it from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nnson1209/littleLemon.git
   cd your-repo-directory

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

This command installs all the necessary packages listed in the package.json file.

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app in the development mode using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   
This command starts the development server and opens the app in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

The page will reload whenever you make changes to the source files. Any linting errors will also appear in the console for easy debugging.
